                    Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, it stands as one of the most iconic structures in the world. Here are
                    key details about the Taj Mahal:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>History:</strong> The Taj Mahal was commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in
                        memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth in 1631. The construction
                        began in 1632, and it took approximately 22 years to complete the entire complex.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Architectural Style:</strong> The Taj Mahal is a prime example of Mughal architecture,
                        which combines elements of Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles. It is primarily made of white
                        marble and features intricate inlay work using precious and semiprecious stones.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Design and Layout:</strong> The Taj Mahal is laid out in a charbagh (four-part garden)
                        style, with a central structure flanked by identical buildings on each side. The main structure
                        is a large white marble mausoleum with a central dome and four minarets. The complex is
                        surrounded by a garden with pathways, water channels, and reflecting pools.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Central Dome:</strong> The central dome is one of the most distinctive features of the
                        Taj Mahal. It is adorned with intricate geometric and floral designs and culminates in a
                        decorative lotus-shaped finial. The dome represents the heavens and the celestial abode.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Minarets:</strong> Four minarets stand at each corner of the main platform, providing a
                        sense of balance to the structure. They are slightly tilted outward to protect the main
                        mausoleum in case of an earthquake.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Inlay Work:</strong> The Taj Mahal is renowned for its exquisite inlay work, known as
                        pietra dura. This technique involves using colored stones and gems to create intricate patterns
                        and designs on the marble surface.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Calligraphy:</strong> The exterior of the Taj Mahal features inscriptions from the
                        Quran, written in calligraphy, praising Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan. The calligraphy is an
                        integral part of the decorative elements.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Site:</strong> The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World
                        Heritage Site in 1983 in recognition of its cultural and historical significance.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>The Taj Mahal is not only a symbol of love but also a marvel of architectural beauty. It attracts
                    millions of visitors from around the world who come to admire its grandeur, craftsmanship, and the

                    to the Taj Mahal and is sometimes referred to as the "Baby Taj" due to its similar use of white

                        adorned with delicate carvings and inlay work using semiprecious stones. This decorative
                        technique, known as pietra dura, involves the use of colored stones to create intricate floral
                        and geometric patterns.

                    <li>
